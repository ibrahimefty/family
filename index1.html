									<p><b>Name: MD.Ibrahim,Mother Name:Asma Bagom,Date of Birth 18 Oct 2000.</b>Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements.

An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence. Note: Not all paragraphs need topic sentences.

In particular, opening and closing paragraphs, which serve different functions from body paragraphs, generally don’t have topic sentences.</p>
